Here are some utility scripts that I use on my personal machine. These are 
primarily written in Bash. To use *a la carte*, simply add the directories
containing the desired scripts to your ```$PATH``` environment variable.

On my personal machine, I have the utility directory located in ```$HOME```. To
easily create a new script, I use the ```utility.sh``` file located in the root
folder. This script simply creates a new executable shell script file and places
a corresponding symlink in the ```~/utilites/bin``` directory. To use
```utility.sh``` in the command line, you should first add it to your
```$PATH``` environment variable.
